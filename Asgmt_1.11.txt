# The architecture design of an e-commerce application must 
# encompass the important high-availability principles. 

# High-availability refers to -  
# The ability of a system to remain operational and accessible for an extended period of time, with minimal downtime. 
# This is achieved by designing a system that is :- 
# 1) Fault-tolerant, 
# 2) Scalable, 
# 3) Redundant. 

# Some high-availability principles that can be applied to an e-commerce application: 

# Redundancy: For this, we plan for multiple servers to take over in case of a failure. 
#             For example, multiple web servers to handle incoming traffic in case one server goes down. 

# Scalability: For this we design the system that to handle increased traffic as the application grows vis Auto Scaling Group. 
#              Achieved by adding more servers or by using load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple servers. 

#Fault-tolerance: We design the system to continue operation even if one or more components fail. 
#                  For example, having multiple database servers to take over in case one server goes down. 

# Disaster recovery: In consideration of disaster recovery we install a plan to recover from disasters such as power outages, natural disasters, or cyber attacks. 
#                    Achieved via backups of data and systems in different geological location place. 

# In oredr to implement the above-mentioned principles, we employ the following types of servers: 

# Web servers: 
#               These servers handle incoming traffic from users and serve web pages. 

# Application servers: 
#               These servers run the application code and handle business logic. 

# Database servers: 
#               These servers store data used by the application. 

# Load balancers: 
#               These servers distribute incoming traffic across multiple web or application servers. 

# Cache servers: 
#               These servers store frequently accessed data in memory to reduce the load on database servers. 

# Backup and recovery servers: 
#               These servers are used to backup data and systems and recover from disasters. 

# It is vital to note that the specific types of servers required is dependant on the requirements of the e-commerce application and the expected traffic volume.
